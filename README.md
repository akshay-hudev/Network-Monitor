Network Sensory Monitor — Advanced is a real-time network intelligence tool built with Python and Tkinter that visualizes network stability using live latency, jitter, packet loss, and real Ookla Speedtest integration.
It simulates core computer networking concepts like routing algorithms, congestion control, packet scheduling, ARP monitoring, and QoS classification — all inside an interactive GUI dashboard.
